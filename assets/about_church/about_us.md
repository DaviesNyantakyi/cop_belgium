The commencement of the church 

The late Deaconess Gisella Van Brusselt, spearheaded the commencement of the Church of Pentecost in Belgium through a divine directive, which she received in 1990. 

According to the late Deaconess Gisella Van Brusselt , she heard an audible voice that said, “Through You, I will build my Church in Belgium so go to Ghana and bring back my church to Belgium.” 

“I have not been to Ghana before and how can I know the Church?” She replied. The voice of the Lord instructed her to go. “Just go and I will lead you”. Said the Lord.
